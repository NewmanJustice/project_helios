## Task

Implement the feature according to the plan. Work incrementally, making tests pass one group at a time.

## Inputs (read these files)

- Implementation Plan: {FEAT_DIR}/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- Tests: {TEST_FILE}

## Process (INCREMENTAL - one file at a time)

1. Run tests using the project's test command (see `.claude/stack-config.json`)
2. For each failing test group:
   a. Identify the minimal code needed
   b. Write or edit ONE file
   c. Run tests again
   d. Repeat until group passes
3. Move to next test group

## Outputs

- Source files as specified in the implementation plan
- All tests passing

## Rules

- Write ONE source file at a time
- Run tests after each file write
- Keep functions small (under 30 lines)
- Code should be self-documenting, minimal comments
- Do NOT commit changes
- Do NOT modify test assertions unless they contain bugs
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Label assumptions explicitly: `ASSUMPTION: [statement]`
- If tests pass but behaviour feels wrong, stop and flag to the human

## Implementation Principles

- Clarity over cleverness
- Match existing patterns in the codebase
- Validate inputs defensively
- Handle errors gracefully

## Completion

Brief summary: files changed (list), test status (X/Y passing), blockers if any.
